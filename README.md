# google-kickstart
These are my code to the Google Kickstart competitions. 

Please note that I do not have much experience in competitive coding, so I am only able to complete 1-2 questions each kickstart round, and not all of the submissions
are correct as well. 

But feel free to suggest any Python inputs to any of the rounds! And please feel free to provide me with feedback too, thanks!
